    "# Scenario:  You are tasked with designing a simplified library management system in Python for a local library.\n",
    "# The system needs to manage books, library members, and their borrowings. Implement the following classes based on the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class: Book - Properties: title, author, ISBN, is_available. - Methods:\n",
    "# __init__(self, title, author, ISBN): Initializes the book with the title, author, and ISBN.\n",
    "# borrow(self): Marks the book as borrowed (is_available = False) if it is available.\n",
    "# return_book(self): Marks the book as available (is_available = True).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulate the properties to prevent direct modification from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class: Member - Properties: name, member_id, and borrowed_books (a list of borrowed book instances). - Methods:\n",
    "# __init__(self, name, member_id): Initializes the member with a name and ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "# borrow_book(self, book: Book): Allows the member to borrow a book. Adds the book to borrowed_books if the book is available.\n",
    "# return_book(self, book: Book): Allows the member to return a borrowed book and remove it from their borrowed list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class: Staff (Inherits from Member) - Additional Property: position. - Additional Method:\n",
    "# __init__(self, name, member_id, position): Initializes the staff member with a name, member ID, and position.\n",
    "# Class: Librarian (Inherits from Staff) - Additional Method:\n",
    "# add_book(self, book: Book): Allows the librarian to add new books to the library collection.\n",
    "# Polymorphism Requirement: - Implement a method get_details(self) in both Member and Staff classes to return information specific to that class.\n",
    "# - For Member, it should return the member's name and ID. - For Staff, it should additionally return the staff's position.\n",
    "# Abstraction Requirement: - Create an abstract base class LibraryUser with abstract methods borrow_book and return_book.\n",
    "# Both Member and Staff should inherit from LibraryUser and implement these methods.\n",
    "# Task:\n",
    "# Write the code to implement the scenario above, demonstrating the following OOP concepts: 1. Encapsulation: Use private attributes \n",
    "# and provide getters and setters if needed. 2. Inheritance: Show the use of inheritance with Staff and Librarian classes. \n",
    "# 3. Polymorphism: Demonstrate how get_details behaves differently for Member and Staff.\n",
    "# 4. Abstraction: Use the abstract base class LibraryUser to enforce the interface for borrowing and returning books.\n",
