    "## Exercise: Build a Simple Log File Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task Description:\n",
    "1. Write a Python program that:\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Opens a file (log.txt) in append mode to store log messages.\n",
    "- Allows the user to either: <br>\n",
    "       1. Write a new log entry: Prompt the user for a message and append it to the file with a timestamp. <br>\n",
    "       2. Read all log entries: Read and display all the contents of the file. <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Handles possible errors, such as: <br>\n",
    "      1. The file not existing or being inaccessible.<br>\n",
    "      2. Invalid user input.<br>\n",
    "      3. Attempting to read an empty file.<br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "`Steps`:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Menu Options**:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should display a menu like this:\n",
    "   1. Write a new log entry\n",
    "   2. Read all log entries\n",
    "   3. Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "2. File Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. When the user selects Option 1 (write a log entry): <br>\n",
    "             - Prompt them for a log message. <br>\n",
    "             - Append the message to log.txt with the current date and time. <br>\n",
    "         \n",
    "    2. When the user selects Option 2 (read log entries):<br>\n",
    "             - Open log.txt in read mode. <br>\n",
    "             -Display the contents or handle errors like an empty or non-existent file. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exception Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions like:\n",
    "         - FileNotFoundError: If the file doesn’t exist when trying to read. <br>\n",
    "         - IOError: General input/output errors (e.g., permission issues).<br>\n",
    "         - ValueError: For invalid user inputs (like typing a letter when a number is expected).<br>\n",
    "         - Use a finally block to ensure the file is properly closed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bonus`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement error handling for reading an empty file, printing a message like \"No log entries found.\""

    "# File Handling Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Log File Analyzer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python script to read a large log file (you can simulate one by generating thousands of lines with different formats) and extract information like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error messages\n",
    "- Warning messages\n",
    "- Timestamps of each log entry\n",
    "- Store this information in a separate summary file.\n",
    "- Bonus: Implement a function to search for specific error messages or warnings by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. File Compression Utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Python script that takes a directory as input, compresses all text files (.txt) into a single ZIP file, and names it based on the current date.\n",
    "- Bonus: Add a feature that decompresses a ZIP file and restores the text files to the original directory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 3. Configuration File Reader/Writer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a Python script that can read a configuration file in .ini, .json, or .yaml format, parse its contents, and modify specific values based on user input. Save the updated configuration back into the file.\n",
    "- Bonus: Add error handling to detect if the format is incorrect and raise appropriate exceptions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 4. Binary File Manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a script that reads a binary file (e.g., an image file) and converts it into a base64 encoded string. Then, decode the base64 string back into the original binary format and save it to a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonus: Ensure that the original and recreated binary files are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data Migration Between Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a Python program that reads data from a CSV file, processes it (e.g., convert it to JSON format or apply some transformations), and writes the processed data to a new file.\n",
    "- Bonus: Handle different delimiters and malformed rows with exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception Handling Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Robust Calculator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a calculator program that accepts user input for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).\n",
    "- Implement exception handling for:\n",
    "   - Division by zero\n",
    "   - Invalid operator\n",
    "   - Non-numeric input\n",
    "   - Bonus: Continue to prompt the user until valid input is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Network File Downloader with Retries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a Python script that attempts to download a file from the internet using urllib. If the download fails due to a network issue, the script should retry a certain number of times before raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonus: Implement an exponential backoff strategy for retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Database Connection Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulate a database connection scenario where a script tries to connect to a database. Handle exceptions like:\n",
    "    - Invalid credentials\n",
    "    - Connection timeout\n",
    "    - SQL errors (you can use SQLite or MySQL with simple queries)\n",
    "    - Bonus: Ensure proper closing of the connection, even in the event of an error, using finally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Custom Exception Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create custom exception classes for a banking application. The exceptions could include:\n",
    "  - `InsufficientFundsError`\n",
    "  - `NegativeDepositError`\n",
    "  - `UnauthorizedWithdrawalError`\n",
    "\n",
    "-Write a function that performs bank transactions (deposit, withdrawal) and raises these exceptions as needed.\n",
    "-Bonus: Log the errors into a file with timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. User Authentication System:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a user authentication system that:\n",
    "      - Prompts the user for a username and password.\n",
    "      - Reads from a user file or database to validate credentials.\n",
    "      - Implements exception handling for:\n",
    "      - Incorrect passwords\n",
    "      - Non-existent user\n",
    "      - File/database access issues\n",
    "- Bonus: Implement a lockout system where the user is locked out after 3 failed attempts and logged in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combination Exercise (File + Exception Handling)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Backup System with Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a Python program that:\n",
    "    - Reads a list of file paths from a configuration file.\n",
    "    - Copies these files to a backup directory.\n",
    "    - Implements error handling for:\n",
    "           - Files that don’t exist\n",
    "           - Insufficient permissions to read/write a file\n",
    "           - Disk space issues\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonus: Create logs for successful and failed file operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. File Parsing with Exception Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a script that reads from a file, processes the data, and writes the result to another file. Ensure the script: <br>\n",
    "         - Handles common file errors like FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and corrupt files. <br>\n",
    "         - Includes a try-except-finally block to ensure the file is properly closed.\n",
    "- Bonus: Implement custom exceptions for invalid data formats and log these errors into a file.\n"
