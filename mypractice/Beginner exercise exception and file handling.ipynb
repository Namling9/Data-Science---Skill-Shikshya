    "# File Handling Exercises\n",
    "### 1. Simple File Reader/Writer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task: Write a Python script that:\n",
    "      - Opens a text file, reads its contents, and prints them line by line.\n",
    "      - Then, prompts the user to enter a new line and appends it to the file.\n",
    "- Challenge: Ensure the script doesn’t overwrite the existing file contents.\n",
    "- Hint: Use the open() function with r mode for reading and a mode for appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Word Frequency Counter\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that reads a text file, counts the occurrences of each word, and writes the results to a new file.\n",
    "- Challenge: Ignore case sensitivity and remove punctuation (such as commas, periods, etc.).\n",
    "- Bonus: Sort the words by frequency before writing them to the output file.\n",
    "### 3. Line Numbering in a File\n",
    "- Task: Write a script that reads a file and writes its content to another file, but with each line numbered (e.g., 1. First line, 2. Second line).\n",
    "- Challenge: Make sure to handle empty lines correctly and number them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. File Copier\n",
    "- Task: Write a Python program that copies the contents of one file to another.\n",
    "- Challenge: If the destination file already exists, prompt the user to confirm overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. CSV File Reader\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that reads a CSV file (comma-separated values) and prints each row.\n",
    "- Challenge: Convert the rows into Python dictionaries where the keys are the column headers.\n",
    "- Bonus: Handle CSV files with missing values gracefully by filling in \"N/A\" or another placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception Handling Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Divide Two Numbers\n",
    "      - Task: Write a program that prompts the user for two numbers and divides them. Implement exception handling to catch\n",
    "      - ZeroDivisionError and ValueError (for non-numeric input).\n",
    "      - Challenge: Keep asking for valid input until the user enters two valid numbers.\n",
    "### 7. File Opener with Exception Handling\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that asks the user for a filename and attempts to open it. If the file doesn’t exist, catch the FileNotFoundError and prompt the user again until a valid file is entered.\n",
    "- Bonus: Add handling for PermissionError in case the file cannot be read due to permissions.\n",
    "### 8. Temperature Converter with Exception Handling\n",
    "- Task: Create a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The program should handle ValueError if the user enters a non-numeric value.\n",
    "- Challenge: Implement exception handling to detect if the temperature is below absolute zero (−273.15°C) and raise a custom ValueError.\n",
    "### 9. Custom Exception Class\n",
    "- Task: Define a custom exception called InvalidAgeError that is raised when someone tries to input an age less than 0 or greater than 150.   Write a program that prompts the user for their age and raises this exception for invalid input.\n",
    "- Bonus: Add error handling to make sure the input is numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combination of File and Exception Handling\n",
    "### 10. File Search with Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that:\n",
    "     - Prompts the user for a word and searches for that word in a text file.\n",
    "     - Prints the line number and the line content where the word is found.\n",
    "     - If the word is not found, it should print a message saying so.\n",
    "##### Exception Handling:\n",
    "    - Handle the case where the file doesn’t exist (catch FileNotFoundError).\n",
    "    - Handle the case where the word is not found.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 11. File Manager with Error Handling\n",
    "- Task: Write a Python script that performs the following file management operations:\n",
    "     - Lists all files in a directory.\n",
    "     - Asks the user for a filename to delete.\n",
    "     - Deletes the file if it exists.\n",
    "     - Catches FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.\n",
    "- Bonus: Implement a confirmation prompt before deleting the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Student Grades from File\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that reads a file containing students’ names and their grades (one per line, e.g., John, 85).\n",
    "          - Calculate and print the average grade.\n",
    "          - Identify and print the highest and lowest grades.\n",
    "##### Exception Handling:\n",
    "        - Handle missing or malformed grade entries.\n",
    "        - Catch FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Text File Encryption/Decryption\n",
    "- Task: Write a Python script that encrypts and decrypts a text file using a simple Caesar cipher (shifts letters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet).\n",
    "       - Provide options to the user to encrypt or decrypt.\n",
    "       - Write the result to a new file.\n",
    "#####  Exception Handling:\n",
    "          - Handle any file errors (e.g., FileNotFoundError).\n",
    "          - Handle invalid input (e.g., non-alphabetic characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. File Statistics with Error Handling\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that opens a text file and calculates statistics like:\n",
    "        - Number of characters\n",
    "        - Number of words\n",
    "        - Number of lines\n",
    "        - Longest word\n",
    "##### Exception Handling:\n",
    "        - Handle empty files.\n",
    "        - Handle file reading errors (like FileNotFoundError).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenges\n",
    "### 15. Read and Write Binary Files\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that reads a binary file (like an image or audio file) and copies it to another file.\n",
    "Challenge: Implement error handling for file operations.\n",
    "- Bonus: Compare the original and copied file to ensure they are identical.\n",
    "### 16. JSON File Reader/Writer\n",
    "- Task: Write a program that reads a JSON file, manipulates the data (e.g., adds a new key-value pair), and writes the updated data back to the file.\n",
    "##### Exception Handling:\n",
    "- Handle malformed JSON data using json.JSONDecodeError.\n",
    "- Handle file errors (e.g., FileNotFoundError).\n"
